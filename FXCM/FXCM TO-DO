FXCM TO-DO

MLPClassifier is a multi-layer perceptron classifier
MLP fit(X,y) method fits to data matrix X and target y
the predict method requires X features to be passed in to predict Y
%time is used inline to time processes
accuracy_score is simply how many were correct/total
return is the change between point x and point x+1
predictions are simply -1/0/+1
value_counts method simply counts number of occurences for each value
if df is one column, you can call just df without adding df[col]
log is used to scale variables


determine best number of layers and iterations
test model with different date ranges- do we need more or less data points?
test prophet to predict- maybe a NN is less accurate



% symbol in python- what does it do? (probably in RE library)
need to do some pandas training
dataframe resampling

compare fees between FXCM and etoro: does it make sense to continue with etoro project?
